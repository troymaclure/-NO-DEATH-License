# -NO-DEATH-License
Reflection about an open source license granting the right to use source code with the reservation the resulting logiciel or modified source code will not be included in a device intended to put people to death against their will, such people including individuals, groups of individuals or the mankind as a whole.


## Introduction
The ultimate weapon, the one which will destroy modern civilization, will be controled by open source code or code based on open source code. 

Modern weapons currently under development or modernization, being supersonic ICBM (hello china), automatic or autonomous weapons (russian tanks), swarm of drone, killer satellite and so on require more and more sofisticated softwares (as complexe as a complete operating system) to control them. There is very little chance Windows or MacOS, proprietary, will ever be used in such case. The best bets lie on code with the most active development, the most recent innovation and the largest knowledge base and documentation. Which means either OS based on Linux kernel or BSD family with the inclusion of recent real time OS.

Open source projects have, generally, an unifying consequence among diverse religious, ethnic, cultural, sexual, neurotype, gender and so on background. A common langage, english, which happens to be also the universal language for scientific publication and diplomacy, allow developers to communicate betweens each others, which is more or less the untold standard on Github, with the rare exception of localised repositories of softwares intended for users in a specific language. As such open source philosophy have probably a pacifying effect among developers. But it is not garantee of inclusion, tolerance and sharing or pacific intends among all of its users. Some might be interested only in available materials whitout feeling the need to give back to the community, or even in some case have strong racial, religious, eugenics, nationalist prejudice towards others communities or have radical conviction about how the legal system should be implemented or how justice should be served, regardless of human rights and the most fundamental of them, the right to live, and are willing to manufacture devices controlled by open source code with the intend of delivering death. It's a matter of time before we read a post on hacker news about a death machine being "proudly powered" by open source code.

Of course, maintainers of source code project might argue it's not their responsabilities to decide how the source they produce will be used, but let's be realistic : If the leaked source code powering a death machine responsible for the death of relative(s), peers, nationals happens to be the Linux kernel version 5.0... I'm pretty sure you will think twice before contributing again or even using a Linux computer. In the case of large scale death machines, projects might be entirely banned or abandonned by maintainers or provoke PTSD syndromes on these maintainers and ruin their live.

## Fictitious cases studies
- The religious group and the purification of the mankind through the instrument of God.
- The political group and the automation of eradication of the vermine.
- The randomized trigger of the death machine, or the modernization of the blank ammunition principle in military execution procedure.
- The supersonic ICBM trajectory control system.

## Discussion
### Whats should not be included ?
- Abortion : The debate about the moment in pregnancy a foetus is "alive" or whatever the ethical/legal argument is dependant of the country, religious or political affiliation of the people participating in such a debate and will not be resolved worldwide anytime soon. To make such license available, we can make an agreement about the meaning of "DEATH". In a strictly logical point of view, "Death" implies first being "Born". As such, the word "Death" in the license will only apply on subject being previously "Born", which means having going through the process of "Birth" whatever the moment of this birth (premature) or this birth being medicaly induced prematurilly. 
- Euthanasia, under reservation of medical supervision and/or patient will : (The license should comply implicitally with the legal requirement and/or limitation of the local law where the device using the source code or modified source code is used. The developper of the licensed source code should then aknowledge the limitation/extend of the license in such case will be different depending of the country it will be used). 

### Towards an Add-ons modele of license.

The current open source license model is limited to the legal term regarding the publication of the code, modified code, author name or code of the resulting software as well as the possible licenses under which the modified code can be published and the resulting software can be used.

That model don't take into account the kind of use which can be made of the code. The developer publishing its code under open source license accept tacitly their code can be used for whatever purpose. 

The ideological stance of the open source community and the sofware development community at large is that computer revolution, which is the result of commulative scientific and intellectual innovations through history dating back to era as old as ancient greeks (Boolean logic), is fundamentally good for the mankind as one of the most cuting edge technology it ever enginered. As such, its use should not be restricted beside its publishing terms.
